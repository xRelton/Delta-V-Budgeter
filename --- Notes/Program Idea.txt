Delta V Map (make visual with Unity)
- Click start point
- Click end point
- Adds delta v from map to calculate total
- Tick/untick aerobraking for free landing on sufficiently atmospheric worlds
- Tick/untick round trip
- Choose from a list of spacecraft with fuel slider to see how much delta v they would generate -> changes delta v calculation values, can also change manually (next point)
- Create own spacecraft (plug into https://strout.net/info/science/delta-v/)
- Have an output being positive or negative if spacecraft has enough delta v to make the trip

Profit?


assuming burns are at periapsis, and gravity assist and inclination changes are ignored
(effectively max Delta V any transfer should cost)


TODO
----------------
- Add all data
- Spaceship UI
- Select ship
- Select how many stages available
- Fuel slider
- Payload slider
- Output DV
